The handed in code consists of three parts: 
VGG16.py: 1) A CNN with pretrained weights from VGG16 with dropout 0.5. 
ResNet50_250: 2) A CNN with pretrained weights from ResNet50 with dropout 0.5 & L2 reg. and the used image size is 250x250.
ResNet50_224.py: 3) A CNN with pretrained weights from ResNet50 with dropout 0.5 and the used image size is 224x224.

Majority.py: We combined the predictions from the previous files in a majority vote which is our final prediction submission.
